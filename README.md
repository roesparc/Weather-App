## JS Promises, Async / Await and APIs

The main goal of this project is to make use of Promises and Async / Await functionality to retrieve weather data from a weather API and use it in the app, allowing for the display of current weather conditions in specified locations.

### Features

- Let users search for specific locations and show the current weather
- Give the option to toggle between Fahrenheit or Celsius
- Display weather symbols that match the current weather
- Change the background color based on if it's day or night at the searched location
